We propose KAHAN, a knowledge-augmented hierarchical framework that systematically extracts insights from raw tabular data at entity, pairwise, group, and system levels. KAHAN uniquely leverages LLMs as domain experts to drive the analysis. On DataTales financial reporting benchmark, KAHAN outperforms existing approaches by over 20% on narrative quality (GPT-4o), maintains 98.2% factuality, and demonstrates practical utility in human evaluation. Our results reveal that knowledge quality drives model performance through distillation, hierarchical analysis benefits vary with market complexity, and the framework transfers effectively to healthcare domains.
